## What is accessibility

Accessibility is a quality. It means how easily and effectively a product or service can be accessed and used.

Good accessibility is designed for the full range of capabilities, as well as for the context of use or environmental constraints.

## Why is accessibility important

At some point in our lives, disability will affect most of us, not matter who we are, especially as we get older.

Great design starts by thinking about how to make products work for everyone.
